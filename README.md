## A collection of my dotfiles
Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system. You can tell that a file is a dotfile because the name of the file will begin with a periodâ€“a dot! The period at the beginning of a filename or directory name indicates that it is a hidden file or directory. This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs. Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.
